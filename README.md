dstruct
=======

Will provide some data structures for use in Fortran, which should also be
easy to adapt.

Compiles and runs currently with:
 + gfortran (10.2.0)
 + nvfortran (20.9-0)

Currently here can be found:
 + AVL tree, you can currently neither remove elements nor can you traverse
   the tree with iterators
